The Imperial scouts have over the decades brought back the
terrain and site information on this map; only folk-knowledge from locals has
more information (and PCs are welcome to interact with them to find out more
about where loot could be found).

**Eagle Pass**. The walled town serving as the homebase for the campaign. It’s
at the mouth of a mountain pass: behind, westward, lay the more settled lands
of the empire; before lay the trackless lands of the eastern marches. The town
has a few thousand people in it. The current legate evacuated the garrison of
Fort Dauntless years ago, and brought it back into the town to fortify the
town’s militia, when the sitting Emperor withdrew the Eagle Pass legion for
other duties.

**Pine-top, Oak-bluff**. The two largest villages near Eagle Pass. The denizens
of Pine-top are mostly Imperial citizens; those in Oak-bluff, mostly native.

**Fort Dauntless**. This used to be the forward picket for the Empire’s
presence in the area. Now it’s periodically staffed by a small watch
semi-regularly staffed from the Eagle Pass garrison.

**Temple Ruin**. An ancient Eldar temple, recently uncovered by a landslide.

**Stonehell Prison**. Under Darius, Stonehell was used as a prison on the far
edge of the empire, to receive all manner of undesirables and criminal nasties,
whether truly guilty or not. After Darius’ removal, an Imperial task group
carried out a liberation and strategic shut-down of the Stonehell
facility. What the force found there was unpleasant and rarely talked
about. No-one has gone there in decades; nobody would dare.

**The Lost Field**. The site of a great battle between a massed rag-tag army of
beastmen and an imperial legion. First, the beastmen descended upon and
murdered the crew of citizens working on extending the imperial road. Then,
they were descended upon and pacified by the garrison at Fort Dauntless. It’s
unlikely that the tribes in the region have forgotten.

**The Dark Table**. This massive dolmen/henge site is known to be a religious
site of importance to beastfolk tribes in the region.

**Cold River, Sawgrass River, Endless Marsh**. The Cold River is the main river
that runs north-south up through the map. The bridge to the east of Fort
Dauntless cross the Cold River. The Sawgrass River branches off the Cold, and
heads gradually east and north. The Endless Marsh is a massive lowland marsh at
the confluence of several rivers joining the Cold.

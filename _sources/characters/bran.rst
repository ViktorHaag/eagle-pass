   * - Background
     - Family all died in a fire when Bran was 4; taken by a priest and raised
       within the temple of Lathander (God of Sun, Birth, Renewal), so has
       little practical experience outside the temple; believes that folk must
       help bring about the change the gods are constantly working the world;
       owes his life to the priest who took him in, and trusts perhaps too much
       in the hierarchy of the church; young and quite eager to purge the world
       of evil; tall, gangly, and awkward.

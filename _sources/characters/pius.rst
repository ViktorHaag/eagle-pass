   * - Background
     - Folk Hero; Pius was a reknowned blacksmith and community leader in a
       prosperous mountain village to the west of Eagle Pass; when a corrupt
       legate tried to extort all the village's wealth to line his own pockets,
       Pius refused to compliy; he rallied the villagers to fight back, and
       together they drove off the legate and his men; unfortunately, the
       humiliated legate convinced the provincial governer to crush the
       village, demonstrating that insurgency would not be tolerated; the
       village was destroyed, and Pius was forced to flee.
   * - Best at
     - Blacksmithing, wielding divine fire, boosting the power of his allies;
       he knows a lot about religioun and history; he's also a surprisingly
       decent brawler, thanks to beefy blacksmith muscles, although he lacks
       strong combat skills.
   * - Worst at
     - Pius knows nothing about arcane magic, martial arts, or skullduggery;
       he's also very bad at prioritization and strategy, deteremined to help
       all the people all the time, regardless of the consequences.
   * - Kicker
     - Whenever Pius sees people oppressed or endangered, he's going to feel
       obliged to step in and do whatever he can to help; despite the disaster
       that befell his former village, he believes that he's been divinely
       chosen to be a defender of the people and a force for justice.

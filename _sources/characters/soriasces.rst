   * - Background
     - Hermit; I escaped my hometown many years ago when a horrific magical
       incident occurred in the community; although I didn't actually cause it,
       I'm convinced I did (and chances are, the villagers I left behind are,
       too); I adopted a new identity and have been wandering the world ever
       since; I tend to stay in one place only as long as it helps me to
       increase my arcane knowledge; I am particularly interested in
       catastrophes, the more apocalyptic, the better.
   * - Best at
     - Focus; I pursue my goals tenaciously and try not to let setbacks
       distract me.
   * - Worst at
     - Risk assessment; I find impending doom fascinating rather than
       frightening.
   * - Kicker
     - I've heard rumours of a horrific entity gather power in the lands east
       of Eagle Pass, preparing to unleash death and destruction on an
       unsuspecting civilization; in my experience, it tpyically doesn't turn
       out to be interesting, but I always try to keep a positive attitude
       about these things.

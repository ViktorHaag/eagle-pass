     - Thikk was captain of the Dwarven pirate ship IronCarver, one of my
       dwarven ships forced into a life of piracy when their remote mountainous
       island ran out of natural resources; times were tough, and unwilling to
       trade with local Elven ports, many Dwarves decided to take what they
       needed; though not particularly good at sailing, Thikk was good at
       intimidating others and his ship the IronCarver, adorned with black
       sails, rows of cannon and crossbows, and a small detachment of heavily
       armed dwarves, struck fear into the hearts of nearby trading vessels;
       one such vessel yielded a chest, containing a map to what appears to be
       a lost city made of gold; Thikk abandoned his crew, pocketing the map,
       and has gone in search of this mysterious city.

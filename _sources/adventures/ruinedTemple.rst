Episode One: The Startled Lumberjack
------------------------------------
*Scribe*. Socriasces.

Pinetop is a village roughly four leagues East of Eagle Pass in an idyllic part
of the mountainous countryside. The party left Eagle Pass in the morning and
arrived in Pinetop early afternoon, where they met with the smith Bruno Schmidt
to discuss what had occurred to his cousin Konrad Schmidt. Pius and Bruno knew
of each other by reputation and the party and Bruno quickly gained each others'
trust.

Konrad is a woodcutter by trade. Much of his work this time of year takes him
out into the forests East of Pinetop, where he spends several days camping,
chopping trees, and gathering his wares. Depending on the client, sometimes
rare trees would need to be harvested, as was the case when he went into the
woods before the incident. Bruno informed the party that Konrad had been out
longer than usual on this run, and some of the villagers had been worried about
him. Fortunately, he returned to Pinetop, however he had clearly encountered
something traumatizing, to the point that his hair turned white.

Since the party was interested in hearing more of the story from Konrad's point
of view, Bruno agreed to take them to see his cousin. Although Konrad's wife
was protective of her husband, she nevertheless trusted Bruno (and the party
was sufficiently gracious) to be allowed to see Konrad.

Konrad was in the backyard, sitting under a blanket convalescing. He was still
obviously shaken by his experience, but provided the party with more details:
Konrad had stopped to camp while on his way to a Rosewood grove, and that night
a mudslide ocurred nearby. The next morning, anticipating that he might have
been able to acquire some wood from the trees that might have been uprooted by
the slide, he went to investigate. The mudslide had apparently unearthed the
stone tower of an old, buried building. Curious, he went closer to
investigate. He climbed up to look through a hole in the tower wall, but the
next thing he remembered is running terrified through the woods, with no
recollection of what had ocurred in the intervening time. Ever since, he has
had reoccuring nightmares of cold, the smell of moss, and teeth.

The party decided to re-tread Konrad's jouney by camping out in the same
campsite that night, and to seek out the Rosewood grove the next morning. In
order to make it to the campsite by evening, they set out immediately.

As they neared the campsite, they saw two men and three dogs approaching from a
different direction. Not wanting to make assumptions, but also being cautious
of brigands in the woods, they called out to the other party. The two men then
loosed two of the dogs towards the party, in apparent aggression. Still wanting
to avoid a confrontation, the party took a defensive stance where they stood:
The two halflings (Soriasces and Alton) climbed nearby trees, and Elodin sort
of cowered behind Pius.

Using practiced hand gestures, Pius instructed the dogs to stand down once they
arrived, asserting a sort of compassionate dominance over them. Then once the
men arrived, he struck a nearby tree with his hammer, causing an impressive
earthquake. This persuaded the men and their dogs to retreat. The rest of the
party, while not contributing much to the encounter in the strictest sense, was
appropriately impressed.


Episode Two: Burning Bushes
---------------------------
*Scribe*. Soriasces.

After persuading the bandits to retreat to their camp, the party continued to
the site where Konrad had directed them. Upon arriving they found a natural
cave stocked with provisions, and made camp. The party hunted and foraged to
spare their rations. They found enough food to sustain them for dinner that
evening and a hearty breakfast the next morning. Alton also discovered some
poisonous berries that Pius prevented him from eating.

They prudently set a schedule of watches, but the night passed
uneventfully. The next morning - the halflings having ensured they left the
campsite in better shape than they'd found it - the party set off towards the
supposed location of the tower. On the way, Alton became suspicious of a nearby
bush and stabbed it ineffectually.

Although the rest of the party did not take Alton's threat assessment
seriously, his concern about the vegetation was eventually vindicated. Three
bramble bushes approached him threateningly from behind as they proceeded on
the path to the tower.

Alton quickly killed one of the bush creatures; the other two tried to flank
him. Soriasces then cast a spell of sufficient potency that Alton suddenly fell
asleep mid-combat. Fortunately, Elodin woke him up almost immediately by
slapping him with Mage Hand.

Pius was able to find one of the flanking bramble creatures, who seemed also to
have been put to sleep to the side of the path. When Soriaces' spell wore off,
the creature woke up, and Pius destroyed it with Sacred Flame. Although Elodin
was unable to find the second bramble creature in the brush, Alton saw it
retreating in the distance and shot it with his crossbow, killing it as well.

Elodin insisted they gather the bodies of the creatures and burn them before
moving on. The party made sure not to cause any forest fires in the process.


Episode Three: Oh Deer
----------------------
*Scribe*. Soriasces

The party continued walking until dusk, when they noticed sounds of a commotion
off the path. Pius immediately jumped from the road, caught his foot on a
protruding root, fell down a 200-foot gully, and landed heavily in a small
clearning. Alton descended acrobatically, and without sustaining any
injuries. The wizards followed with more caution.

Before Pius was able to regain his footing, a doe and fawn approached from the
edge of the clearing, exhibiting uncharacteristic bravery. Watching more
closely, the party became increasingly concerned about the health of the deer,
who were proceding with a clear lack of grace, seemed to be bloody, and perhaps
even aggressive.

Fearing that the deer might mean them harm, Soriasces struck the doe in the
snout with his quarterstaff, generating a disturbing amount of gore to come
loose from the deer, but not discouraging it. The doe - whose body actually
appared not only to be injured, but rotting - retaliated on the wizard,
striking Soriasces hard with her head.

Alton and Elodin, recognizing the threat caused by the deer, each attacked one
of the animals. Pius, meanwhile, pursued the commotion they heard earlier, and
left the clearing. However, unable to hear the sounds of struggle from before,
he returned. Neither deer had stopped attacking, despite the damage incurred
from Alton's rapier and Elodin's magic. Pius dispatched the doe with a radiant
attack.

While the others were attending to the doe, Elodin engaged the fawn in combat
alone. Despite repeated hits with fire bolts, the fawn chased the elf back up
the gully. Falling backwards to the ground, Elodin cast a magical shield on
himself in terror. Fortunately, he was rescued when the rest of the party,
having finished off the doe, dismembered the fawn to prevent its approach. Pius
then killed it with radiant damage.

After the encounter, they were able to determine where the earlier commotion
had come from: a party of men and dogs had seemingly been assulted and
partially consumed by wild animals; potentially the work of the deer. Elodin
insisted they burn the bodies of the deer, the men, and the dogs, fearing
contamination from, or even reanimation of, the bodies.

After the fire, the party made camp back up on the path. They hoped that
putting some distance between themselves and the clearing might make subsequent
attacks by rotting animals less likely, and that the watches they posted that
night would be uneventful.


Episode Four: The Eldritch Tower
--------------------------------
*Scribe*. Soriasces

The night passed uneventfully. Having had a good sleep and a hearty breakfast,
the party continued towards the rosewood grove that Konrad had told them about,
feeling healthy and refreshed. They quickly came upon the tower they had been
seeking. The Earth had eroded away in an apparent landslide, revealing a tall
cylindrical stone structure. The base was very tall and had the girth of a
large cedar tree. The cylinder was topped with a large ovoid, roughly the size
of a guard tower. The architecture gave the impression of organic growth: the
walls were smooth; the seams and joints looked like living tissue rather than
traditional masonry. The top of the tower especially brought to mind an
enormous flower bulb or onion, complete with stone ornamentation resembling
petals, leaves, or sprouting roots. There was no apparent entrance into the
tower.

Pius remarked that the appearance of the structure was consistent with his
knowledge of ancient Eld architecture.

Looking more carefully, Elodin noticed a crack in the side of the tower, part
way between the ground rubble caused by the landslide and the bottom of the
bulb. He climbed up through the crack with the aid of Soriasces' rope, and
assisted the rest of the party inside.

The room was wedge-shaped: wider against the outer wall than towards the centre
of the tower. The walls curved parabolically in towards the far wall, where a
circular door was installed. The room inside the tower was empty aside from
rubble that had fallen through the crack during the disturbance outside. The
circular door had a spiral design. The walls themselves were decorated with a
great deal of Eld script.

The party spent some time deciphering the words written on the walls by
torchlight. The words were religious in nature, proclaming the wonder of
fertility and growth, and recording many names. One name that occurred
prominently was Gulfius. It seemed to the party that this was a sarcred space
devoted to a deity of fertility, possibly in the context of birthing rituals.

The door did not open, despite the party's best efforts. Soriasces and Alton
knocked on it, which caused an echo on the other side of the door, indicating
another room. Pius told the door to "open" in Eld, but that had no
effect. Elodin attacked the door with fire magic, to which the entire room
seemed to respond negatively with a shudder. This reaction made Soriasces
uncomfortable, and he recommended they leave the tower.

The party exited the room through the crack they entered. Outside, they climbed
up the eroded hillside to get closer to the top of the tower. At the top of the
hill, they could stand within eight feet of the edge of the "bulb," although a
failed attempt to jump across the gap could result in falling down the hill. As
Pius had previously discovered, falling down a hill of this height could be
quite damaging.


Episode Five: Two Nurseries
---------------------------
*Scribe*. Soraisces

Eight feet from the bulbous top of the Eldrich tower, the party discussed
options for getting across without harming themselves. They settled on sending
Soriasces' weasel familiar Ginger across to scout the roof for
entrances. Elodin lifted Ginger with Mage Hand and set her down on the roof.

Through Ginger's eyes, Soriasces reported that there was an opening in the tip
of the bulb that was large enough for a person to descend into. The party
decided to cross over to the roof. Elodin and Soriasces coordinated
simultaneous uses of Mage Hand to tie a rope off on the roof. Elodin then
crossed the chasm with a second rope, creating a bridge the others were able to
use to cross the chasm.

One of the bridge ropes was retrieved to lower into the darkness of the tower
attic. None of the party could see what was inside. Soriasces dropped a torch
down the hole, and it fell for a time before disappearing into the darkness and
eventually coming to rest far below.

Alton descended first, with another torch. Below him, he was able to see a
spiral staircase that descended down through the centre of the tower, with the
top floor of the tower around the edge. The architecture here was very similar
to the room they entered through a crack in the outside wall: organic,
unsettling, and a little bit sticky.

The walls of the top floor also had Eld words written on them. The rest of the
party joined Alton and tried to decipher the script. It seemed to be providing
care and feeding instructions of various types of plants.

Attempting to orient himself towards the room they had been in before, Pius
touched the wall he surmised would be opposite the door they were unable to
open. At his touch, an orifice opened in the stone, revealing the empty room,
with a crack up the far wall to the outside.

Excited by the prospect of discovering more rooms, Soriasces touched the wall
opposite Pius. It, too, opened in the same way. This room, however, was
occupied. Roughly fifty hard, bulbous sacks the size of a human hung from the
walls.

The rest of the party joined Soriasces in the room to inspect the sacks. They
were warm to the touch, and clearly had something warm and alive inside.

While Soriasces tried and failed to open any more doors in the atrium, Elodin
decided to cut open one of the sacks. He had to saw through the hard, wood-like
casing with his knife. Amniotic fluid gushed out, followed by the sack’s
inhabitant: A green, branchy creature similar to the bushes that had assaulted
them the day before.

Determining that the plant creature was aggressive, Alton dispatched it with
his rapier. Elodin, alarmed at his discovery, started to cast a spell with the
intention of burning all of the sacks and the creatures inside them. Before he
could accomplish this, however, Soriasces returned to the room and tackled him,
breaking his concentration, temporarily saving the sacks and their contents.

The party left the room and reflected briefly on the benefits of and potential
problems with eradicating the room with fire. Elodin, reconsidering his idea,
reasoned that it was probable that the creatures may not be very vulnerable to
fire, since they seemed to be made of green shoots that do not burn very well.

The party attempted to close the door to the seed room by touching it, and the
door closed. They also closed the door to the room with the crack. Looking at
the Eld script again, they discovered that the doors they had opened described
their contents as, roughly, “The Small Ones.” There were six other distinct
areas around the walls, with two other types of directions. The party concluded
then, that there were two other kinds of creatures within the walls, and also
that the room they had initially entered had once been occupied with egg-sacks,
and was not anymore. They hypothesized that the creatures may have hatched and
escaped through the crack in the wall.

Confident that they now knew where the bush creatures they’d encountered had
come from, and having a rough idea of how many others might be out in the
forest, the party decided to learn more about the tower’s inhabitants. They
descended the staircase in single-file.

They had not descended for very long when Pius announced that two beings were
coming up the stairs towards them, and he was fairly certain their company was
already dead.


Episode Six: TBD

*Scribe*. TBD

During this session, the party met with danger and almost entirely fell. Pius
and Soriasces are dead. Elodin is gravely injured.

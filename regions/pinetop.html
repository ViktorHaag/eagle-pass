<h1>Pine-top village<a class="headerlink" href="#pine-top-village" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Pine-top is one of the few villages left in the foothills below Eagle Pass that
still has a mostly imperial population. The countryside around Pine-top is very
hilly, coniferous and mixed forest. Along the eastern edge of the region, the
Cold River falls out of the mountains and moves quickly through steep ravines
towards the meadows and grasslands farther north.</p>
<div class="section" id="travel-in-the-region">
<h2>Travel in the region<a class="headerlink" href="#travel-in-the-region" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The only easy travel in the region is along the imperial road that goes through
Pine-top village towards Fort Dauntless and the Stonhell Prison.</p>
<p><strong>Mountains</strong>. Mountain hexes along the edge of the map, next to Eagle Pass,
and those surrounded by mountain hexes, are generally impassable for travel
through them, but those with climbing equipment and specialized knowledge of
the area may be able to find slow ways through the hexes.</p>
<p>Mountain hexes next to forest hexes are very difficult terrain; a full day’s
travel can get through them.</p>
<p><strong>Forest</strong>. Forest hexes are generally difficult terrain, especially those with
hills in them, and require a half day’s travel to pass through.</p>
<p><strong>Road</strong>. The road through the region is a well-built, imperial road, with
stone quarried from the mountains around Eagle Pass.</p>

<h2>Notable hexes<a class="headerlink" href="#notable-hexes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>0122</strong>. <em>Eagle Pass</em> – Walled imperial fort town, population a few
thousand. Eagle Pass was planned and constructed as a bullwark to hold the pass
west into the Empire. It is easily holdable against forces without strong
military organization or siege engineering.</p>
<p><strong>0222</strong>. <em>Quarry</em> – The quarries that yielded the stone to build the
buildings and walls of Eagle Pass, and the roads to Fort Dauntless and the
prison are in this hex. They were prepared by top-flight imperial engineers and
are still used by masons in Eagle Pass, but they are a shadow of their former
industry.</p>
<p><strong>0321</strong>. <em>Pine-top village</em> – Pallisaded imperial farming village, population a
few hundred. About two thirds of the population in the village, and the
farmsteads around it, are imperial settlers. The village has weekly markets, a
smithy, a carpenter or two, a tanner and leatherworker, a chandler, a weaver, a
cooper, and a brewer. The village is technically governed by the legate at
Eagle Pass, but in practical terms, most matters are handled by a council of
the senior professionals in the village.</p>
<p><strong>0421</strong>. <em>Black Charles and his gang</em> – A gang of brigands, lead by the
thuggish Black Charles, have a camp in the hills here. They frequently descend
upon traffic on the road to their north and west, and anyone travelling on the
road who cares to listen can be warned of their presence by the folk in
Pine-top. The brigands often patrol the woods around their camp in small
groups, hunting for food, along with several mastiffs; when holding up traffic
on the roads, they typically appear in larger numbers.</p>
<p><strong>0521</strong>. <em>Ruined Eld temple</em> – An ancient Eldritch temple has recently had its
upper dome unearthed, thanks to a rock and mud slide down a hill after a
storm. The unsealing of the temple has resulted in several threats slowly
spreading out over the nearby countryside:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Spores from the temple, sealed up for centuries, have taken root, and it’s
not uncommon to find various spawn of Gulthias in the surrounding woods:
twiglings and needlers, in particular.</li>
<li>A wight, resident of the upper reaches of the temple dome, has killed and
infected several creatures, turning them into zombies. Now, they reside in
the temple dome as well, and wander the woods, hungry for flesh.</li>
</ul>

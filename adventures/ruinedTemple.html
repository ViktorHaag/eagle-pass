<h2>Episode One: The Startled Lumberjack<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-one-the-startled-lumberjack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Socriasces.</p>
<p>Pinetop is a village roughly four leagues East of Eagle Pass in an idyllic part
of the mountainous countryside. The party left Eagle Pass in the morning and
arrived in Pinetop early afternoon, where they met with the smith Bruno Schmidt
to discuss what had occurred to his cousin Konrad Schmidt. Pius and Bruno knew
of each other by reputation and the party and Bruno quickly gained each others’
trust.</p>
<p>Konrad is a woodcutter by trade. Much of his work this time of year takes him
out into the forests East of Pinetop, where he spends several days camping,
chopping trees, and gathering his wares. Depending on the client, sometimes
rare trees would need to be harvested, as was the case when he went into the
woods before the incident. Bruno informed the party that Konrad had been out
longer than usual on this run, and some of the villagers had been worried about
him. Fortunately, he returned to Pinetop, however he had clearly encountered
something traumatizing, to the point that his hair turned white.</p>
<p>Since the party was interested in hearing more of the story from Konrad’s point
of view, Bruno agreed to take them to see his cousin. Although Konrad’s wife
was protective of her husband, she nevertheless trusted Bruno (and the party
was sufficiently gracious) to be allowed to see Konrad.</p>
<p>Konrad was in the backyard, sitting under a blanket convalescing. He was still
obviously shaken by his experience, but provided the party with more details:
Konrad had stopped to camp while on his way to a Rosewood grove, and that night
a mudslide ocurred nearby. The next morning, anticipating that he might have
been able to acquire some wood from the trees that might have been uprooted by
the slide, he went to investigate. The mudslide had apparently unearthed the
stone tower of an old, buried building. Curious, he went closer to
investigate. He climbed up to look through a hole in the tower wall, but the
next thing he remembered is running terrified through the woods, with no
recollection of what had ocurred in the intervening time. Ever since, he has
had reoccuring nightmares of cold, the smell of moss, and teeth.</p>
<p>The party decided to re-tread Konrad’s jouney by camping out in the same
campsite that night, and to seek out the Rosewood grove the next morning. In
order to make it to the campsite by evening, they set out immediately.</p>
<p>As they neared the campsite, they saw two men and three dogs approaching from a
different direction. Not wanting to make assumptions, but also being cautious
of brigands in the woods, they called out to the other party. The two men then
loosed two of the dogs towards the party, in apparent aggression. Still wanting
to avoid a confrontation, the party took a defensive stance where they stood:
The two halflings (Soriasces and Alton) climbed nearby trees, and Elodin sort
of cowered behind Pius.</p>
<p>Using practiced hand gestures, Pius instructed the dogs to stand down once they
arrived, asserting a sort of compassionate dominance over them. Then once the
men arrived, he struck a nearby tree with his hammer, causing an impressive
earthquake. This persuaded the men and their dogs to retreat. The rest of the
party, while not contributing much to the encounter in the strictest sense, was
appropriately impressed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-two-burning-bushes">
<h2>Episode Two: Burning Bushes<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-two-burning-bushes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Soriasces.</p>
<p>After persuading the bandits to retreat to their camp, the party continued to
the site where Konrad had directed them. Upon arriving they found a natural
cave stocked with provisions, and made camp. The party hunted and foraged to
spare their rations. They found enough food to sustain them for dinner that
evening and a hearty breakfast the next morning. Alton also discovered some
poisonous berries that Pius prevented him from eating.</p>
<p>They prudently set a schedule of watches, but the night passed
uneventfully. The next morning - the halflings having ensured they left the
campsite in better shape than they’d found it - the party set off towards the
supposed location of the tower. On the way, Alton became suspicious of a nearby
bush and stabbed it ineffectually.</p>
<p>Although the rest of the party did not take Alton’s threat assessment
seriously, his concern about the vegetation was eventually vindicated. Three
bramble bushes approached him threateningly from behind as they proceeded on
the path to the tower.</p>
<p>Alton quickly killed one of the bush creatures; the other two tried to flank
him. Soriasces then cast a spell of sufficient potency that Alton suddenly fell
asleep mid-combat. Fortunately, Elodin woke him up almost immediately by
slapping him with Mage Hand.</p>
<p>Pius was able to find one of the flanking bramble creatures, who seemed also to
have been put to sleep to the side of the path. When Soriaces’ spell wore off,
the creature woke up, and Pius destroyed it with Sacred Flame. Although Elodin
was unable to find the second bramble creature in the brush, Alton saw it
retreating in the distance and shot it with his crossbow, killing it as well.</p>
<p>Elodin insisted they gather the bodies of the creatures and burn them before
moving on. The party made sure not to cause any forest fires in the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-three-oh-deer">
<h2>Episode Three: Oh Deer<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-three-oh-deer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Soriasces</p>
<p>The party continued walking until dusk, when they noticed sounds of a commotion
off the path. Pius immediately jumped from the road, caught his foot on a
protruding root, fell down a 200-foot gully, and landed heavily in a small
clearning. Alton descended acrobatically, and without sustaining any
injuries. The wizards followed with more caution.</p>
<p>Before Pius was able to regain his footing, a doe and fawn approached from the
edge of the clearing, exhibiting uncharacteristic bravery. Watching more
closely, the party became increasingly concerned about the health of the deer,
who were proceding with a clear lack of grace, seemed to be bloody, and perhaps
even aggressive.</p>
<p>Fearing that the deer might mean them harm, Soriasces struck the doe in the
snout with his quarterstaff, generating a disturbing amount of gore to come
loose from the deer, but not discouraging it. The doe - whose body actually
appared not only to be injured, but rotting - retaliated on the wizard,
striking Soriasces hard with her head.</p>
<p>Alton and Elodin, recognizing the threat caused by the deer, each attacked one
of the animals. Pius, meanwhile, pursued the commotion they heard earlier, and
left the clearing. However, unable to hear the sounds of struggle from before,
he returned. Neither deer had stopped attacking, despite the damage incurred
from Alton’s rapier and Elodin’s magic. Pius dispatched the doe with a radiant
attack.</p>
<p>While the others were attending to the doe, Elodin engaged the fawn in combat
alone. Despite repeated hits with fire bolts, the fawn chased the elf back up
the gully. Falling backwards to the ground, Elodin cast a magical shield on
himself in terror. Fortunately, he was rescued when the rest of the party,
having finished off the doe, dismembered the fawn to prevent its approach. Pius
then killed it with radiant damage.</p>
<p>After the encounter, they were able to determine where the earlier commotion
had come from: a party of men and dogs had seemingly been assulted and
partially consumed by wild animals; potentially the work of the deer. Elodin
insisted they burn the bodies of the deer, the men, and the dogs, fearing
contamination from, or even reanimation of, the bodies.</p>
<p>After the fire, the party made camp back up on the path. They hoped that
putting some distance between themselves and the clearing might make subsequent
attacks by rotting animals less likely, and that the watches they posted that
night would be uneventful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-four-the-eldritch-tower">
<h2>Episode Four: The Eldritch Tower<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-four-the-eldritch-tower" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Soriasces</p>
<p>The night passed uneventfully. Having had a good sleep and a hearty breakfast,
the party continued towards the rosewood grove that Konrad had told them about,
feeling healthy and refreshed. They quickly came upon the tower they had been
seeking. The Earth had eroded away in an apparent landslide, revealing a tall
cylindrical stone structure. The base was very tall and had the girth of a
large cedar tree. The cylinder was topped with a large ovoid, roughly the size
of a guard tower. The architecture gave the impression of organic growth: the
walls were smooth; the seams and joints looked like living tissue rather than
traditional masonry. The top of the tower especially brought to mind an
enormous flower bulb or onion, complete with stone ornamentation resembling
petals, leaves, or sprouting roots. There was no apparent entrance into the
tower.</p>
<p>Pius remarked that the appearance of the structure was consistent with his
knowledge of ancient Eld architecture.</p>
<p>Looking more carefully, Elodin noticed a crack in the side of the tower, part
way between the ground rubble caused by the landslide and the bottom of the
bulb. He climbed up through the crack with the aid of Soriasces’ rope, and
assisted the rest of the party inside.</p>
<p>The room was wedge-shaped: wider against the outer wall than towards the centre
of the tower. The walls curved parabolically in towards the far wall, where a
circular door was installed. The room inside the tower was empty aside from
rubble that had fallen through the crack during the disturbance outside. The
circular door had a spiral design. The walls themselves were decorated with a
great deal of Eld script.</p>
<p>The party spent some time deciphering the words written on the walls by
torchlight. The words were religious in nature, proclaming the wonder of
fertility and growth, and recording many names. One name that occurred
prominently was Gulfius. It seemed to the party that this was a sarcred space
devoted to a deity of fertility, possibly in the context of birthing rituals.</p>
<p>The door did not open, despite the party’s best efforts. Soriasces and Alton
knocked on it, which caused an echo on the other side of the door, indicating
another room. Pius told the door to “open” in Eld, but that had no
effect. Elodin attacked the door with fire magic, to which the entire room
seemed to respond negatively with a shudder. This reaction made Soriasces
uncomfortable, and he recommended they leave the tower.</p>
<p>The party exited the room through the crack they entered. Outside, they climbed
up the eroded hillside to get closer to the top of the tower. At the top of the
hill, they could stand within eight feet of the edge of the “bulb,” although a
failed attempt to jump across the gap could result in falling down the hill. As
Pius had previously discovered, falling down a hill of this height could be
quite damaging.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-five-two-nurseries">
<h2>Episode Five: Two Nurseries<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-five-two-nurseries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Soraisces</p>
<p>Eight feet from the bulbous top of the Eldrich tower, the party discussed
options for getting across without harming themselves. They settled on sending
Soriasces’ weasel familiar Ginger across to scout the roof for
entrances. Elodin lifted Ginger with Mage Hand and set her down on the roof.</p>
<p>Through Ginger’s eyes, Soriasces reported that there was an opening in the tip
of the bulb that was large enough for a person to descend into. The party
decided to cross over to the roof. Elodin and Soriasces coordinated
simultaneous uses of Mage Hand to tie a rope off on the roof. Elodin then
crossed the chasm with a second rope, creating a bridge the others were able to
use to cross the chasm.</p>
<p>One of the bridge ropes was retrieved to lower into the darkness of the tower
attic. None of the party could see what was inside. Soriasces dropped a torch
down the hole, and it fell for a time before disappearing into the darkness and
eventually coming to rest far below.</p>
<p>Alton descended first, with another torch. Below him, he was able to see a
spiral staircase that descended down through the centre of the tower, with the
top floor of the tower around the edge. The architecture here was very similar
to the room they entered through a crack in the outside wall: organic,
unsettling, and a little bit sticky.</p>
<p>The walls of the top floor also had Eld words written on them. The rest of the
party joined Alton and tried to decipher the script. It seemed to be providing
care and feeding instructions of various types of plants.</p>
<p>Attempting to orient himself towards the room they had been in before, Pius
touched the wall he surmised would be opposite the door they were unable to
open. At his touch, an orifice opened in the stone, revealing the empty room,
with a crack up the far wall to the outside.</p>
<p>Excited by the prospect of discovering more rooms, Soriasces touched the wall
opposite Pius. It, too, opened in the same way. This room, however, was
occupied. Roughly fifty hard, bulbous sacks the size of a human hung from the
walls.</p>
<p>The rest of the party joined Soriasces in the room to inspect the sacks. They
were warm to the touch, and clearly had something warm and alive inside.</p>
<p>While Soriasces tried and failed to open any more doors in the atrium, Elodin
decided to cut open one of the sacks. He had to saw through the hard, wood-like
casing with his knife. Amniotic fluid gushed out, followed by the sack’s
inhabitant: A green, branchy creature similar to the bushes that had assaulted
them the day before.</p>
<p>Determining that the plant creature was aggressive, Alton dispatched it with
his rapier. Elodin, alarmed at his discovery, started to cast a spell with the
intention of burning all of the sacks and the creatures inside them. Before he
could accomplish this, however, Soriasces returned to the room and tackled him,
breaking his concentration, temporarily saving the sacks and their contents.</p>
<p>The party left the room and reflected briefly on the benefits of and potential
problems with eradicating the room with fire. Elodin, reconsidering his idea,
reasoned that it was probable that the creatures may not be very vulnerable to
fire, since they seemed to be made of green shoots that do not burn very well.</p>
<p>The party attempted to close the door to the seed room by touching it, and the
door closed. They also closed the door to the room with the crack. Looking at
the Eld script again, they discovered that the doors they had opened described
their contents as, roughly, “The Small Ones.” There were six other distinct
areas around the walls, with two other types of directions. The party concluded
then, that there were two other kinds of creatures within the walls, and also
that the room they had initially entered had once been occupied with egg-sacks,
and was not anymore. They hypothesized that the creatures may have hatched and
escaped through the crack in the wall.</p>
<p>Confident that they now knew where the bush creatures they’d encountered had
come from, and having a rough idea of how many others might be out in the
forest, the party decided to learn more about the tower’s inhabitants. They
descended the staircase in single-file.</p>
<p>They had not descended for very long when Pius announced that two beings were
coming up the stairs towards them, and he was fairly certain their company was
already dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-six-the-undead-and-the-dead">
<h2>Episode Six: The Undead and the Dead<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-six-the-undead-and-the-dead" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Soriasces</p>
<p>Two undead humanoids ascended the stairs towards the party. Pius and Elodin
tried to fend them off from the top of the stairs with radiant and fire magic
respectively. Alton and Soriasces rounded the landing to be able to aim
downwards at the tops of the attackers’ heads.</p>
<p>Soriasces, failing to strike effectively with his quarterstaff, jumped down
from the ledge to the stairway. The undead humanoid in the rear turned to
attack him. Although Soriasces failed to push his assailant off the stairs,
Alton was able to cleave the zombie in half. Even so, the half-zombie continued
advancing on Soriasces, inflicting damage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Pius and Elodin destroyed both zombies before Soriasces was too
badly injured, and Pius healed him back up to full health. Emboldened by a
successful encounter, the party descended the stairs to the floor below.</p>
<p>The lower floor was smaller than the top floor, roughly round, and empty aside
from the descending staircase. A hallway extended off from a far wall. Once
Alton, Soriasces and Pius reached the landing, they noticed three figures
approaching from that hallway: two humanoids and a dog. They quickly identified
them as three more zombies.</p>
<p>Alton armed himself with a bow to fire at the zombies from a distance. He and
Pius retreated back up the stairs with Elodin, while Soriasces edged along the
wall in an attempt to draw one attacker off from the pack. Soriasces attacked
one monster with Chill Touch, getting its attention. They engaged in combat,
but the rest of the party lost sight of them from the stairs. The dog and the
second zombie chased the other three up the stairs.</p>
<p>Elodin focused his fire magic on the dog while Alton and Pius attacked the
humanoid. Unfortunately, Pius’ radiant attacks missed frequently. The zombie
knocked Pius unconscious before Alton was able to kill it. Once he killed the
dog, Elodin tried to stabilize Pius but was unable to save him, and the cleric
died.</p>
<p>The second zombie then approached from where it had been attacking
Soriasces. Realizing that Soriasces had likely lost the fight, Alton hurried
into the room. He found Soriasces dead on the floor. Elodin fended off the
second zombie as well as he could before also being knocked out. Alton returned
to the staircase, killed the remaining zombie, and stabilized Elodin.</p>
<p>Shaken and eager to return home, Alton dragged his three party members into the
empty room with the crack, and waited for Elodin to regain consciousness. When
Elodin awoke, Alton explained what had occurred. They agreed to loot and burn
Soriasces and Pius’ bodies in the event that the undeath affliction was
contagious. They returned to Eagle Pass.</p>

<h2>Episode Seven: Return to the Tower<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-seven-return-to-the-tower" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Corwynn</p>
<p>After a disturbing night of cowering in the birthing chamber as something
scratched against the door, Elosin and Alton escaped the temple through the
crack in the outside wall. They spent the next day traveling back to the
woodcutter’s camp.</p>
<p>They reached the camp the following morning, and happened upon three strangers
who had been using the camp the previous night. Two of the strangers - Corwynn
and Mad Jack - were arguing about the importance of eating a good breakfast
before leaving.</p>
<p>Alton introduced himself to the group, and everyone eventually made each
others’ acquaintance. Foxglove, Mad Jack, and Corwynn had been searching for a
party of four adventurers seeking a mysterious tower. Alton and Elodin revealed
that they had been part of that party, but two of their number had died in the
tower.</p>
<p>Corwynn determined that the halfling wizard that had died in the tower was
likely her long-lost uncle Felix. She confronted Alton about allowing Soriasces
to die and leaving his body behind. Alton and Elodin confirmed that there were
mysterous and Eldrich things occuring at the tower, to Foxglove and Mad Jack’s
increased interest.</p>
<p>The five adventurers decided to form a new party and return to the tower. They
made their way back to the top floor, then descended the staircase
unimpeded. At the bottom of the stairs they found six dead bodies, arranged
seated back-to-back in a circle, and the body of a dog. Elodin, now fully
recovered, set about burning them. While not a fast or easy process, he
nevertheless made some progress with his fire magic.</p>
<p>Corwynn inspected the body of the halfling and confirmed that Soriasces was
indeed her uncle. The realization hit her hard, and she retreated to the corner
with his body to grieve.</p>
<p>Foxglove scouted down the hallway, and noticed that someone was approaching
them quickly from the other end. Warning those near her to be on alert, she hid
in the shadows and waited. Elodin cast mage armor on himself.</p>
<p>A very tall, long-limbed figure strode into the room and attacked Alton with
two weapons. Mad Jack fired an arrow at the attacker, and Foxglove backstabbed
it from behind. Corwynn, realizing they were under attack, threw a hand axe and
struck the assailant. Alton counterattacked successfully. Nevertheless, the
attacker continued to fight.</p>

<div class="section" id="episode-eight-five-against-one">
<h2>Episode Eight: Five Against One<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-eight-five-against-one" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Corwynn</p>
<p>The party continued their attack on the Eldrich opponent. Alton and Corwyn were
knocked out. Foxglove was struck hard by a mace, and suffered a form of cold
magical weakening. Elodin distracted the Eld with Mage Hand.</p>
<p>Mad Jack was able to revive Alton in time for the halfling to deliver a killing
blow to the Eld, cutting off its head. When Corwynn was revived, she too felt
cold and weak, suffering from the same condition as Foxglove. Elodin determined
that the condition affecting them would pass after a long rest, to the party
retreated to the nursery to do so. Corwynn brought the body of Soriaces with
them.</p>
<p>After the long rest, the party descended further into the tower, exploring the
long hallway off the lower floor. A room off the hall to the left featured a
plynth with a heavy stone top. Despite their best efforts, neither Alton, nor
Foxglove, nor Corwynn were able to open the plynth.</p>

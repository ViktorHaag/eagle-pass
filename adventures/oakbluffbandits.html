<h2>Episode One<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-one" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca.</p>
<p>Oak Bluff is the next small town ouside of Pinetop, north by about half a day.</p>
<p>After gathering as many rumours about the bandits as they could (after settling
their alley-way differences) the party left Eagle Pass first thing in the
morning and arrived in Oak Bluff near end of day, where they acquired lodgings
at the local inn after a stellar performance by Falca of local folk heros that
left the crowd sobbing into their drinks.</p>
<p>The group then began collecting further rumours of the bandit scourge
throughout the evening, engaging in banter with the locals.</p>
<p>There is a small imperial garrison in Oak Bluff, mainly staffed by soldiers of
a peace-keeping capacity, the local jail’s only occupant currently the town
drunk.</p>
<p>The local cousel of elders were convinved to fund the expedition (retroactive,
upon success) assuming that the group would do nothing to bring attention or
the ire of the banditry down upon the town.</p>
<p>Knowing that they would be either successful or dead, the party heartily agreed
to this condition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after positing a number of potential avenues</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“if locals are becoming bandits, we shoulyd just hold their grandmothers
hostage until they surrender”</li>
<li>“Full frontal assault”</li>
<li>“How about we dress up as farmers, you could wear a wig and be the mom, I
could dress as a kid, you could be the dad, and you could hide in the hay in
the wagon because you’re a dwarf”</li>
</ul>
<p>it was decided that the group would approach a local farmer and see if they
could covertly be of assistance when the farmer made their way to market in 4
days time.</p>
<p>Wanting to avoid the Imperial roads to lessen the likelyhood of running into
bandits before they were ready, Thikk “expertly” (along with Bran’s assistance)
guided the group through the wilderness with only a few mis-steps.</p>
<p>After eventually making it to one of the most out-of-the-way farms, there was
discussion as to how to best blend in just in case the bandits were casing the
place:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“I could dress up as a kid and just be one of the farm kids”</li>
<li>“One of the daughters is studying to be a priest, so Bran could pose as
tutor”</li>
<li>“Why don’t we just hide in the barn?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Consensus could not be established.</p>

<h2>Episode Two<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-two" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>After careful consideration, it was decided that the group should abscond with
one of the Pierce family children in order to scout out a known, and oft-used
ambush point.</p>
<p>Though a cart made the travel slower, the group was able to disguse themselves
as a farming family, with Thikk and Artan hidden in the trunk, Bran posing as a
farmer, and Falca and Digery Pierce posing as his children.</p>
<p>Approaching the bend and proported ambush point, Bran spotted a weak line of
smoke streaming from the hilltop. Passing by the ambush point with no trouble,
the group doubled back and daringly rolled out of the cart, leaving PIERCE to
return home.</p>
<p>A deer trail was found, which clearly led upwards into the hill towards the
smoke.</p>
<p>Near the mouth of the trail, blinds and shelters were spotted, and strange
carvings were found in the tree. Falca was able to decipher them, using the
oft-used D&amp;D skill of Thieves’ Cant. These writings seemed to be inventories
of past robberies.</p>
<p>The party then carefully made their way up the hill until voices were heard.
Falca moved forward stealthfully to investigate. A rogue branch snapped and
the conversation quickly ceased, but just as quickly picked up again.</p>
<p>Moving closer to the conversation, Falca observed three bandits (their yellow
and black scarves clearly visible), and masterfully (almost too much so)
mimicked a triple cry of a local bird and readying her bow.</p>
<p>Deciding that this was the signal to advance, Thickk began laughing
histerically, and charged up the hill. In the initiall confusion, Falca
released an arrow, catching a bandit just beneath the eye (SNEAK ATTACK!). The
other two jumped over the table, flipping it over on its side and hid behind
it, drawing weapons.</p>
<p>Thikk advanced on their position and too a mighty swing at the nearest bandit,
who parried the blow with his shortsword. Artan artfully lobbed a ball of acid
at the two bandits, who were both scalded in the ordeal. Falca released
another arrow, catching the second bandit in the ear (SNEAK ATTACK!) dropping
him as well.</p>
<p>Bran, unleashing holy power, commanded the final bandit to DROP IT, but
something was lost in holy to bandit translation, and the bandit dropped to the
ground. Moments before Thikk plunges his axe into the skull of the final
bandit, Artan rushes forward yelling “REMEMBER, WE WANT ONE ALIVE!” at which
point the bandit quickly surrenders.</p>
<p>Under careful and pointed (there was an arrow pointed at his head)
interrogation, the bandit provided the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the band of bandits claim to be the “Ghost Beggars”</li>
<li>this group was a scouting party and expected back the next day</li>
<li>The name of the head bandit: Zorell</li>
<li>the head bandit is not an idiot and probably won’t just send another scouting
party in search of the last one</li>
<li>we would make good bandits</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="episode-three">
<h2>Episode Three<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-three" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>Bran’s insight into the bandit captive’s (Petrok) motivations lead the party to
find out that the bandit hideout is on the south side of the imperial road,
nearby the prison.</p>
<p>Further interrogation of the bandit captive revealed that there are two entries
to the bandit cave, one of them a guard post that is heavily obscured.</p>
<p>Much debate was had about what to do next. The vetting process for entering
the bandit lifestyle was deemed to be too risky to investigate (“here, stab
this baby”)</p>
<p>Bran wanted to burn down the camp. Falca wanted to establish ambush points.
Thikk wanted to kill Petrok.</p>
<p>The party spent the rest of the day prepping the bivouac site for ambush,
tieing up Petrok and throwing him into one of the sheds.</p>
<p>The party set themselves up up-the-hill from the camp in case the bandits
decided to investigate the missing Petrok and party.</p>
<p>The first half of the night passed uneventfully, but on Thikk’s watch rustling
in the bushes drew his attention. After waking Falca, Thikk chucked a large
rock towards the noise to see if it could be startled away. Falca, nervous
that it was a large beast, woke up the others, as Thikk chucked a second rock
which was effective at scaring away a substantially large animal. The rest of
the night passed uneventfully.</p>
<p>The next morning Petrock was found to have escaped by a bolt-hole in the sheds.</p>
<p>And thus the party learned the important lesson of checking the contents of a
prison cell before throwing a prisoner in there. It turns out the shovels and
other implements were useful, Shawshank-style.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-four">
<h2>Episode Four<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-four" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>The party quickly realized they had 3 options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Abandon all plans, leave the local village to face whatever wrath that has
been stirred up</li>
<li>Leave and let the bandits reclaim their camp, with whatever force they
decided to muster, and then re-attack after excess bandits left</li>
<li>Try and locate the bandit hideout with the expectation that the majority of
their people would have been alerted by Petrock and left</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously the group decided to pick option 4: hide out somewhere between the
bandit HQ and the camp, see how many actually showed up to investigate, take
them down if there are few enough, let them pass if there were too many and
head to their base.</p>
<p>Falca and Thikk scouted out a superior ambush location and the party settled
down to wait.</p>
<p>Soon a troop of bandits were heard coming up the path, and the party let them
pass before:</p>
<p>Falca lets loose an arrow that takes a lead bandit in the back of the head,
dropping him. Bran fires a crossbow into the back of one of the trailing
bandits, while Artan lobbed a ball of acid at the rear of the bandit party,
scorching two. Thikk’s throwing axe burried itself into another bandit and he
leapt out of the cover to charge at the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>Arrows flew, axes fell, acid splashed, bandits begged. In short order all 6
bandits were dispatched. Their bodies were pulled into the forest and the
trail somewhat cleaned up. Bran performed final rights and absolutions, in
preparation for the path to the afterlife.</p>
<p>The party decided to hunker down in their ambush location for the night, had a
dinner of dried rations, and set guard.</p>
<p>Thikk’s watch was disturbed by loud rustling in the bushes. Bran began snoring
and Thikk quickly muffled them by jamming his fist into Bran’s mouth.</p>
<p>Bran woke up and was hushed with a whisper of “bear”. Darkvision showed that
the bear-like shape on the ridge had a large beak and was perhaps staring right
at them.</p>
<p>The Owlbear then scampered down the ridge into the forest and wandered into the
woods. In short order the crunching of bones was heard.</p>
<p>At first light Bran was anxious to go check on the state of the bandit’s
worldly shells, Thikk and Artan began following him down the hill and Falca
remained in the ambush point to watch the trail.</p>
<p>Thikk was then hit in the back with a VERY well shot arrow, and a gruff,
authoritative voice yelled out “DROP YOUR WEAPONS!”</p>
<p>And thus the party learned the important lesson of not rolling 3’s and 9’s on
their perception check for the final watch of the day.</p>

<p>(An authoritative voice yelled out “DROP YOUR WEAPONS!”…)</p>
<p>“WAIT” yelled Falca “we’re not bandits, we’re hunters tracking a horrible
beast!”</p>
<p>After deliberation, fakery, managing to remember the name of the entire Pierce
family (including the ox), the team managed to convince the pair on the bluff
that they were NOT bandits, that they were HUNTING bandits (the strewn about
corpses in the trees, ie: the remains of the owlbear, helped).</p>
<p>The pair told our heros that they were also hunters, but weren’t interested in
helping take down the bandits. The party did manage to get some more details
on how to spot the bandit headquarters, and the guarded and hidden sentry post.</p>
<p>Afterwards the party decided to hunker down and wait for the next batch of
bandits that were likely to follow up after the previous bunch failed to report
in after market-day.</p>
<p>They were rewarded a few days later as a large party of well-provisioned
bandits (8 thugs, 2 scouts) came into sight. Falca, up on the ledge, let out a
birdcall to indicate that there was a scout on the bluff.</p>
<p>The birdcall was less than optimal, and the scout froze. After calling up the
second scout, the bandits decided to scale the bluff and continue travel from
there.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the mighty Thikk decides to…</p>

<h2>Episode Six<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-six" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>A scream from the forest: “AHHHH, the Owl Bear is back!  Run, Withal, Run!”</p>
<p>The bandits freeze. The upper scout moves carefully forward, only to be
skewered by a crossbow bolt from an unknown location. He screams and ducks
behind a rock, other bandits move forward, one takes an arrow to the eye and
falls to the ground. Falca takes a dagger to the shoulder from the scout,
“free dagger!”</p>
<p>Thikk throws a hand-axe at the lower scout, missing, then jumps stealthfully
out of the ambush point to begin flanking those on the ground. Another
crossbow bolt flies from the bivouac, missing. A sleep spell drops one of the
bandits, who is slapped awake by another.</p>
<p>A magic missile flies out of the ambush point, taking a bandit in the face,
dropping him. A crossbow bolt hits Artan in the arm, but not before casting
poison spray at an enraged bandit. Bran takes a swing with his mace on the
poisoned bandit but misses, and the bandit jumps into the nest and stabs Bran.</p>
<p>Falca swiftly travels down the hill and into the lower forest. Thikk sneaks up
on the lower scout and decapitates him and engages with two more bandits,
laughing at their ineffectual assaults.</p>

<h2>Episode Seven<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-seven" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>Thikk attempts to dispatch one of the two bandits in front of him and misses,
critically, allowing the two bandits in front of him the chance to attack at
advantage. One wounds him, the other fails to take advantage of the situation,
and pays with his life as Thikk’s backswing takes the bandit’s head off.</p>
<p>Falca pegs the bandit heading up towards the nest in the back and causes him to
stumble.</p>
<p>Artan takes an arrow to the shoulder and drops.</p>
<p>Bran maneuvers himself into position and finally gets to cast burning hands,
torching the bandit immediately threatening him, as well as finishing off the
bandit Falca hit.</p>
<p>Thikk drops the second bandit in front of him as Bran heals Artan.</p>
<p>The party lose sight of the three bandits on the hill. Artan bolts down the
hill to group up with Thikk and Falca.</p>
<p>Thikk charges up the hill after stuffing some dirt into the earlier wound.
Falca notices two of the bandits taking aim at Thikk, is unable to warn Thikk
of their presence before an arrow takes him in the other arm. She does manage
to exact revenge as one of her arrows plunges into the eye of the shooter.</p>
<p>Artan follows Thikk up the hill, tossing an acid splash onto the remaining
bandit, who just took one of Thikk’s hand axes to the shoulder, eliminating
that threat.</p>
<p>The party hunt for the remaining bandit but find no sign of him.</p>
<p>After their rousing success, the party is emboldened and continue on their way
to the bandit camp.</p>
<p>They camp for the night on a secluded bluff that would be difficult to sneak up
on and the next day they continue their journey and search for futher landmarks
of the bandit camp, provided to them by Withal, the hunter.</p>
<p>Falca scouted ahead and identified a few of the landmarks signifying the
proximity of the bandit hideout.</p>
<p>What will they do now?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-eight">
<h2>Episode Eight<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-eight" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>Much whispered discussion about how to proceed …</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Return to town with our batch of 19 bloodied bandit bandanas and rally town
support for a full assault?  (REDSHIRTS anyone?)</li>
<li>Frontal assault in daylight (Thikk)</li>
<li>Bran and Artan dress as bandits, Falca and Thikk Voltron to form a bandit,
and attempt to approach the entrance to see what happens (Falca, duh)</li>
<li>Wait until night and scout the guard post</li>
<li>Scale the cliff and reconnoiter from above</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately it was decided to wait until night and do some scouting.</p>
<p>As night fell, Artan cast light on a stone and gave it to Falca, just in case,
who placed it into a sealed container.</p>
<p>She snuck carefully, using the trail wall as a guide, up to the edge of the
guardpost and listened. Light, steady breathing was heard.</p>
<p>Falca slowly squeezed into the space, confronted by a large, but sleeping, man.</p>
<p>Determining that swift and bold action was required (plus it would make a good
story, “Stories don’t pay the bills” booms a godlike voice from above, “they do
in my case”, whispers Falca), she quickly dispatches the guard with her
shortsword, attempting to cover up the ensuing mess with one of the excess
bandit bandanas in her possession.</p>
<p>Falca then sneaks back to the group, indicating that the lone guard at the
mouth of the tunnel has been “dealt with” (assassin archetype at 3rd level
maybe?)</p>
<p>Obtaining Artan and Bran bandit bandanas as a light disguise, the two humans
move deeper into the cave. They come across a small sleeping quarters, 5 beds,
two filled. This heartened the group, perhaps the bandits were now at half
capacity.</p>
<p>After beckoning Thikk and Falca forward, Bran, with his superior perception,
hears the sleeping wimper of a dog coming from deeper within the the caves.</p>
<p>“Dogs” he whispers. Artan contemplates the use of a sleep spell to disable
this early alarm threat while Falca battles inner demons around further
dispatching of sleeping bandits.</p>
<p>Cue disolve; new scene; an elderly, white haired halfing woman is sitting in
front of her great-grandchildren, regailing them with tales “and that’s when
grandma SLIT THEIR THROATS!”</p>
<p>Emboldened by this touching scene, Falca once again draws her short sword and
stealthfully approaches the first sleeping form…</p>

<p>Falca leans over and quickly dispatches the first bandit.  She quickly moves
over to the other one who is alerted at the last second.  A gurgling noise
escapes the bandit and some shuffling and snuffling of dog noises come from the
hallway.</p>
<p>Artan moves into the hall, peering into the darkness.  Sleepy, stumbly dog
noises come from the gloom.  Artan expertly casts a sleep spell in that
direction and the sound of dog bodies flopping to the floor lightly echoes in
the dark.</p>
<p>Falca passes Thikk a dagger, giving him a “you know what you have to do” look.
For a dwarf in armour, Thikk is enviably stealthy.  He dispatches the 5 sleep
spelled mastifs and peers into the room beyond.  A pile of 3 dogs and 2 bandits
snooze on the other end of the cavern.</p>
<p>One bandit sleepily looks up in Thikk’s direction, but doesn’t have enough
light to startle him into awakedness.  He slowly slips back to sleep after
Thikk pretends to be just another sleeping dog at the entrance-way.</p>
<p>Thikk returns to the group, and he and Falca (palming the lighted rock in her
hand like a flashlight) sneak up to the pile of sleepers, dispatching the dogs
and bandits.  Facla’s alignment slips into CN as she repeatedly stabs one of
the bodies, chanting quietly “this will make a great story, this will make a
great story”, and her previous bond of “I will do anything to prove myself
superior to my hated rival.” slips away and “I idolize a hero of the old tales
and measure my deeds against that person’s.” The hero of this story
<a class="reference external" href="http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Crack%27d_Pot_Trail">http://malazan.wikia.com/wiki/Crack%27d_Pot_Trail</a> materializing in her mind as
her new role-model.</p>
<p>The passage to the left contains old empty barrels and crates, all on pallets,
and seem to have been here quite a long time, as though this cave could have
housed smugglers or some other group previous to the bandits.  A small 3x3
passageway exists in one of the walls.  A dog run perhaps?</p>
<p>The main entrance chamber has a passage that leads to what smells like a
commode, another larger cavern entrance to a bounteous horde of miss-begotten
goods.  Hundreds of gold coins worth of merchandise reside here, possibly
providing a nice, legal front for an A-Team-esque band of murder-hobos, and
also in the main entrance, yet another smaller crack in the wall that would be
difficult for the larger party members to get through.</p>
<p>Within the treasure room, a larger passageway leads into a long, long tunnel.</p>
<p>Tally so far:</p>
<p>24? bandits
7 bandit dogs
1 alignment shift</p>
<p>This will make a great story</p>

<p>After further investigation, the group heads back to the abandoned storage room
and Falca investigates the 3x3 tunnel while Artan and Bran guard the tunnel
entrance in the abandoned store room.  It is dark, and leads to a small,
slightly taller cavern.</p>
<p>Falca goes back and fetches Thikk, who can see in the dark.  Two tunnels exist
in the room, along with a pedestal that after investigation, used to hold a
small statue.</p>
<p>A light ticking comes from the tunnel to the north, so Thikk investigates the
eastward tunnel.  It turns out it leads to a small guard room that has two
entrances, one coming from the main portion of the caverns, one that leads
downwards.  Two guards sit, playing cards, with their back to the small tunnel.</p>
<p>Thikk comes back and fetches Falca.  They sneak up the tunnel, and Falca tosses
a dagger into the back of one of the guards, who yells in surprise.  Thikk
follows, dispatching the other guard.  Falca finishes off the first guard, and
the two short companions leap into the tunnel again as they hear voices coming
to investigate.</p>
<p>4 or 5 bandits enter the room, and one of them shouts “something in the
tunnels!” and a bandit peeks his head in.  Another bandit moves out of view,
possibly looking at what could be a second small tunnel entrance in the room.</p>
<p>Thikk and Falca ponder their next move.  Artan and Bran hear shouting.</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>“They are in the tunnels!” a bandit shouts and then his head disappears from
view.</p>
<p>Thikk and Falca fall back to regroup with Bran and Artan at the small tunnel
entrance, but when they enter the low-ceilinged room, tentacles have emerged
from the other, unexplored passageway.</p>
<p>Abandoning the statuette, Thikk and Falca run back to the others, and they rush
out of the bandit’s hideout and hide at the entrance way, with the expectation
they can ambush the bandits as they either run out to investigate or run away
from the tentacle monster in the midst of their cavern.</p>
<p>After a few hours of no activity, the group gets antsy and sneak back in.
Falca is disappointed at the general lack of stabing.  They hear no activity
from the depths of the caverns, so they decide to investigate the lavatory
passageway, and stumble upon another series of caves.</p>
<p>Past the washrooms, the group find two old imperial chests, filled with old,
uninteresting imperial garments.  Past this they find a small kitchen with a
large birdcage.  The door of the birdcage is open and the cage is gently
swinging, as though someone recently removed the contents of the cage.  The
spoor of the cage indicates a recent inhabitant.  Moving cautiously along the
group finds what was clearly the main lair of the bandits.  An outline in the
dust reveals what looks like the former location of a large chest.  Cart marks
are clear in the dirt floor.  It looks like everyone has left in a hurry.</p>
<p>A shambling sound comes from one of the tunnels.  It’s getting closer…</p>

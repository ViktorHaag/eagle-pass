<h2>Episode One<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-one" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca.</p>
<p>Oak Bluff is the next small town ouside of Pinetop, north by about half a day.</p>
<p>After gathering as many rumours about the bandits as they could (after settling
their alley-way differences) the party left Eagle Pass first thing in the
morning and arrived in Oak Bluff near end of day, where they acquired lodgings
at the local inn after a stellar performance by Falca of local folk heros that
left the crowd sobbing into their drinks.</p>
<p>The group then began collecting further rumours of the bandit scourge
throughout the evening, engaging in banter with the locals.</p>
<p>There is a small imperial garrison in Oak Bluff, mainly staffed by soldiers of
a peace-keeping capacity, the local jail’s only occupant currently the town
drunk.</p>
<p>The local cousel of elders were convinved to fund the expedition (retroactive,
upon success) assuming that the group would do nothing to bring attention or
the ire of the banditry down upon the town.</p>
<p>Knowing that they would be either successful or dead, the party heartily agreed
to this condition.</p>
<p>Ultimately, after positing a number of potential avenues</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“if locals are becoming bandits, we shoulyd just hold their grandmothers
hostage until they surrender”</li>
<li>“Full frontal assault”</li>
<li>“How about we dress up as farmers, you could wear a wig and be the mom, I
could dress as a kid, you could be the dad, and you could hide in the hay in
the wagon because you’re a dwarf”</li>
</ul>
<p>it was decided that the group would approach a local farmer and see if they
could covertly be of assistance when the farmer made their way to market in 4
days time.</p>
<p>Wanting to avoid the Imperial roads to lessen the likelyhood of running into
bandits before they were ready, Thikk “expertly” (along with Bran’s assistance)
guided the group through the wilderness with only a few mis-steps.</p>
<p>After eventually making it to one of the most out-of-the-way farms, there was
discussion as to how to best blend in just in case the bandits were casing the
place:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>“I could dress up as a kid and just be one of the farm kids”</li>
<li>“One of the daughters is studying to be a priest, so Bran could pose as
tutor”</li>
<li>“Why don’t we just hide in the barn?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Consensus could not be established.</p>

<h2>Episode Two<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-two" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>After careful consideration, it was decided that the group should abscond with
one of the Pierce family children in order to scout out a known, and oft-used
ambush point.</p>
<p>Though a cart made the travel slower, the group was able to disguse themselves
as a farming family, with Thikk and Artan hidden in the trunk, Bran posing as a
farmer, and Falca and Digery Pierce posing as his children.</p>
<p>Approaching the bend and proported ambush point, Bran spotted a weak line of
smoke streaming from the hilltop.  Passing by the ambush point with no trouble,
the group doubled back and daringly rolled out of the cart, leaving PIERCE to
return home.</p>
<p>A deer trail was found, which clearly led upwards into the hill towards the
smoke.</p>
<p>Near the mouth of the trail, blinds and shelters were spotted, and strange
carvings were found in the tree.  Falca was able to decipher them, using the
oft-used D&amp;D skill of Thieves’ Cant.  These writings seemed to be inventories
of past robberies.</p>
<p>The party then carefully made their way up the hill until voices were heard.
Falca moved forward stealthfully to investigate.  A rogue branch snapped and
the conversation quickly ceased, but just as quickly picked up again.</p>
<p>Moving closer to the conversation, Falca observed three bandits (their yellow
and black scarves clearly visible), and masterfully (almost too much so)
mimicked a triple cry of a local bird and readying her bow.</p>
<p>Deciding that this was the signal to advance, Thickk began laughing
histerically, and charged up the hill.  In the initiall confusion, Falca
released an arrow, catching a bandit just beneath the eye (SNEAK ATTACK!).  The
other two jumped over the table, flipping it over on its side and hid behind
it, drawing weapons.</p>
<p>Thikk advanced on their position and too a mighty swing at the nearest bandit,
who parried the blow with his shortsword.  Artan artfully lobbed a ball of acid
at the two bandits, who were both scalded in the ordeal.  Falca released
another arrow, catching the second bandit in the ear (SNEAK ATTACK!) dropping
him as well.</p>
<p>Bran, unleashing holy power, commanded the final bandit to DROP IT, but
something was lost in holy to bandit translation, and the bandit dropped to the
ground.  Moments before Thikk plunges his axe into the skull of the final
bandit, Artan rushes forward yelling “REMEMBER, WE WANT ONE ALIVE!” at which
point the bandit quickly surrenders.</p>
<p>Under careful and pointed (there was an arrow pointed at his head)
interrogation, the bandit provided the following pieces of information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the band of bandits claim to be the “Ghost Beggars”</li>
<li>this group was a scouting party and expected back the next day</li>
<li>The name of the head bandit: Zorell</li>
<li>the head bandit is not an idiot and probably won’t just send another scouting
party in search of the last one</li>
<li>we would make good bandits</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="episode-three">
<h2>Episode Three<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-three" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>Bran’s insight into the bandit captive’s (Petrok) motivations lead the party to
find out that the bandit hideout is on the south side of the imperial road,
nearby the prison.</p>
<p>Further interrogation of the bandit captive revealed that there are two entries
to the bandit cave, one of them a guard post that is heavily obscured.</p>
<p>Much debate was had about what to do next.  The vetting process for entering
the bandit lifestyle was deemed to be too risky to investigate (“here, stab
this baby”)</p>
<p>Bran wanted to burn down the camp.  Falca wanted to establish ambush points.
Thikk wanted to kill Petrok.</p>
<p>The party spent the rest of the day prepping the bivouac site for ambush,
tieing up Petrok and throwing him into one of the sheds.</p>
<p>The party set themselves up up-the-hill from the camp in case the bandits
decided to investigate the missing Petrok and party.</p>
<p>The first half of the night passed uneventfully, but on Thikk’s watch rustling
in the bushes drew his attention.  After waking Falca, Thikk chucked a large
rock towards the noise to see if it could be startled away.  Falca, nervous
that it was a large beast, woke up the others, as Thikk chucked a second rock
which was effective at scaring away a substantially large animal.  The rest of
the night passed uneventfully.</p>
<p>The next morning Petrock was found to have escaped by a bolt-hole in the sheds.</p>
<p>And thus the party learned the important lesson of checking the contents of a
prison cell before throwing a prisoner in there.  It turns out the shovels and
other implements were useful, Shawshank-style.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="episode-four">
<h2>Episode Four<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-four" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>The party quickly realized they had 3 options:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Abandon all plans, leave the local village to face whatever wrath that has
been stirred up</li>
<li>Leave and let the bandits reclaim their camp, with whatever force they
decided to muster, and then re-attack after excess bandits left</li>
<li>Try and locate the bandit hideout with the expectation that the majority of
their people would have been alerted by Petrock and left</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously the group decided to pick option 4: hide out somewhere between the
bandit HQ and the camp, see how many actually showed up to investigate, take
them down if there are few enough, let them pass if there were too many and
head to their base.</p>
<p>Falca and Thikk scouted out a superior ambush location and the party settled
down to wait.</p>
<p>Soon a troop of bandits were heard coming up the path, and the party let them
pass before:</p>
<p>Falca lets loose an arrow that takes a lead bandit in the back of the head,
dropping him.  Bran fires a crossbow into the back of one of the trailing
bandits, while Artan lobbed a ball of acid at the rear of the bandit party,
scorching two.  Thikk’s throwing axe burried itself into another bandit and he
leapt out of the cover to charge at the remaining bandits.</p>
<p>Arrows flew, axes fell, acid splashed, bandits begged.  In short order all 6
bandits were dispatched.  Their bodies were pulled into the forest and the
trail somewhat cleaned up.  Bran performed final rights and absolutions, in
preparation for the path to the afterlife.</p>
<p>The party decided to hunker down in their ambush location for the night, had a
dinner of dried rations, and set guard.</p>
<p>Thikk’s watch was disturbed by loud rustling in the bushes.  Bran began snoring
and Thikk quickly muffled them by jamming his fist into Bran’s mouth.</p>
<p>Bran woke up and was hushed with a whisper of “bear”.  Darkvision showed that
the bear-like shape on the ridge had a large beak and was perhaps staring right
at them.</p>
<p>The Owlbear then scampered down the ridge into the forest and wandered into the
woods.  In short order the crunching of bones was heard.</p>
<p>At first light Bran was anxious to go check on the state of the bandit’s
worldly shells, Thikk and Artan began following him down the hill and Falca
remained in the ambush point to watch the trail.</p>
<p>Thikk was then hit in the back with a VERY well shot arrow, and a gruff,
authoritative voice yelled out “DROP YOUR WEAPONS!”</p>
<p>And thus the party learned the important lesson of not rolling 3’s and 9’s on
their perception check for the final watch of the day.</p>

<p><em>Scribe</em>. Falca</p>
<p>(An authoritative voice yelled out “DROP YOUR WEAPONS!”…)</p>
<p>“WAIT” yelled Falca “we’re not bandits, we’re hunters tracking a horrible
beast!”</p>
<p>After deliberation, fakery, managing to remember the name of the entire Pierce
family (including the ox), the team managed to convince the pair on the bluff
that they were NOT bandits, that they were HUNTING bandits (the strewn about
corpses in the trees, ie: the remains of the owlbear, helped).</p>
<p>The pair told our heros that they were also hunters, but weren’t interested in
helping take down the bandits.  The party did manage to get some more details
on how to spot the bandit headquarters, and the guarded and hidden sentry post.</p>
<p>Afterwards the party decided to hunker down and wait for the next batch of
bandits that were likely to follow up after the previous bunch failed to report
in after market-day.</p>
<p>They were rewarded a few days later as a large party of well-provisioned
bandits (8 thugs, 2 scouts) came into sight.  Falca, up on the ledge, let out a
birdcall to indicate that there was a scout on the bluff.</p>
<p>The birdcall was less than optimal, and the scout froze.  After calling up the
second scout, the bandits decided to scale the bluff and continue travel from
there.</p>
<p>It was at this point that the mighty Thikk decides to…</p>

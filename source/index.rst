 Eagle Pass Campaign Guide
---------------------------

This campaign guide contains information about the ongoing West Marches-style
games set in the lands east of the Imperial walled fortress town called Eagle
Pass. Eagle Pass is the eastern-most settlement in The Empire. A hundred years
ago, under the ministrations of the mad Padishah Emperor Darius the Just, the
Empire was forming a strong position extended from Eagle Pass. Then Darius was
… removed from power. In the resulting disarray, the Empire suddenly had to
contend with solidifying its military positions on borders not in the
east. Now, things east of Eagle Pass are a mostly lawless wilderness: an
opportunity for adventure, fame, and glory. There still remain a few hardy
villages and farms in the woods and hills near to Eagle Pass, homesteaded by
generations of Imperial citizens, too stubborn to leave their patch. Their
trade, and even trade from native barbarian tribes-folk, has kept the modest
market in Eagle Pass a going concern.

Despite the empire’s fitful present in the :doc:`region <regions/regions>`,
they were not the first civilized people to inhabit the east marches. Although
now mostly ruled over by beast-folk and barbaric tribes, at one point in the
distant past, these lands were within the dominion of the ancient Eld who were
powerful, well versed in the arcane, decadent, corrupt, and very, very fond of
a style of architecture that penetrated deep underground.

   * - Background
     - Elodin grew up in a small town outside Eagle Pass, raised by a human
       family. He knows nothing of his elfish heritage. One night his human
       parents died of what can only be considered mysterious causes. The
       townsfolk, being quite superstitious, believed him to be cursed or evil
       and drove him from his small village. With no where to go he took up
       shelter in the streets of Eagle Pass, stealing to make ends meat. After
       years of struggling he met an elderly man by the name of Nicos Morieth,
       a scholar of the arcana. He agreed to take Elodin as an apprentice
       working for food and board.
   * - Best at
     - Nimble and fast, making him an excellent pick pocket. Having spent many
       years on the street stealing to feed himself. He also has a fairly good
       memory and learns quickly, something which came in handy while studying
       the arcana.
   * - Worst at
     - He's a weakling, he's been in many fights but has not won a single fight
       without help from a friend or a conveniently placed weapon. He is also
       very poor, having no real home and no real means of income and gold is
       very valuable. He would not hesitate to take something just lying in a
       pocket of something that obviously does not need it. Being an urchin he
       is not very adapt at speaking with people especially the nobility. 
   * - Kicker
     - He wants to find out whom or what killed his parents all those years
       ago. Having read most of the books and feeling as though he has learned
       as much as he can from his master, he's ready to set out to quench his
       thirst for knowledge.

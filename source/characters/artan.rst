   * - Background
     - Soldier; served as a scout for the Empire for many long years, mainly
       because even though I was committed to the cause and not weak enough to
       turn away, I had no sense of combat and was terrible at fighting; I
       could, however, remember a lot of information that isolated scouting
       parties needed to remember, so I wasn't entirely terrible at that; on
       one of my missions, I stumbled upon an ancient temple hidden in an
       underground cavern that exposed me to magic; when my career plan of
       dying for the Empire didn't pan out and I retired, I decided to sink my
       teeth into the magic I had been studying on the side for years.
   * - Best at
     - Remembering specific details and solving problems when given a lot of
       time to deal with them.
   * - Worst at
     - Not great at physical combat or keeping my attention on something
       specific; does not enjoy being wrong.
   * - Kicker
     - After a night of drinking with a comrade from the old days, she
       mentioned that she'd seen ruins similar to the temple that awakened my
       magic off in the lands east of Eagle Pass. I set off to see what else I
       could learn.

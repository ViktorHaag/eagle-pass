   * - Background
     - Noble; from a particularly well-off and ambituous family, sent to a
       mostly human boarding school; eager to fit into his new "clan" at school
       and being intuitive and perceptive, but not particularly intellgent or
       strong, took to fencind and duelling to prove himself and be treated as
       an equal; values camraderie and works to be accepted as an equal.
   * - Best at
     - Nimble, fleet-footed duelling according to traditional rules; intuiting
       what people want and how to gain their respect.
   * - Worst at
     - From a well-off family, and having gotten through school as a popular
       student due to intuition and some luck, I assume that I'm smarter than I
       actually am.
   * - Kicker
     - After graduating from boarding school, I didn't quite fit in with my
       aristocratic human classmates' world, but did not belong back with my
       Halfling family, either, so seeking to use mymartial skills once again
       to find acceptance with a new band of brothers and sisters.

=======================================
 The Bandit Investigators of Oak-bluff
=======================================

  *Heard about town, in the marketplace: Everyone knows that brigands along the
  prison road are getting worse, and they seem more organized. They have
  recently even attacked farmsteads! I do not want to say what they have done
  to the bodies of those theyâ€™ve left behind...*

Episode One
-----------
*Scribe*. Falca.

Oak Bluff is the next small town ouside of Pinetop, north by about half a day.

After gathering as many rumours about the bandits as they could (after settling
their alley-way differences) the party left Eagle Pass first thing in the
morning and arrived in Oak Bluff near end of day, where they acquired lodgings
at the local inn after a stellar performance by Falca of local folk heros that
left the crowd sobbing into their drinks.

The group then began collecting further rumours of the bandit scourge
throughout the evening, engaging in banter with the locals.

There is a small imperial garrison in Oak Bluff, mainly staffed by soldiers of
a peace-keeping capacity, the local jail's only occupant currently the town
drunk.

The local cousel of elders were convinved to fund the expedition (retroactive,
upon success) assuming that the group would do nothing to bring attention or
the ire of the banditry down upon the town.

Knowing that they would be either successful or dead, the party heartily agreed
to this condition.

Ultimately, after positing a number of potential avenues

* "if locals are becoming bandits, we shoulyd just hold their grandmothers
  hostage until they surrender"

* "Full frontal assault"

* "How about we dress up as farmers, you could wear a wig and be the mom, I
  could dress as a kid, you could be the dad, and you could hide in the hay in
  the wagon because you're a dwarf"

it was decided that the group would approach a local farmer and see if they
could covertly be of assistance when the farmer made their way to market in 4
days time.

Wanting to avoid the Imperial roads to lessen the likelyhood of running into
bandits before they were ready, Thikk "expertly" (along with Bran's assistance)
guided the group through the wilderness with only a few mis-steps.

After eventually making it to one of the most out-of-the-way farms, there was
discussion as to how to best blend in just in case the bandits were casing the
place:

* "I could dress up as a kid and just be one of the farm kids"

* "One of the daughters is studying to be a priest, so Bran could pose as
  tutor"

* "Why don't we just hide in the barn?"

Consensus could not be established.
